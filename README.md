## ‚ú® Project Overview
This repository contains the simulation code, heuristic search algorithms, and evaluation scripts used in our mini-research project **‚ÄúAssembly Planning with the Burr Puzzle.‚Äù**  
The goal is to solve a 6-piece Burr puzzle under realistic physics constraints using an **offline reinforcement-learning‚Äìinspired look-ahead search** that combines:

The framework naturally supports **single-arm, dual-arm, or unlimited-arm** virtual manipulators and records assembly plans that can be replayed or exported.

## üéØ Key Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Physics-aware Motion Feasibility** | Collision detection + gravity support checks using *trimesh* |
| **Configurable Look-ahead** | `top_k`, `rollout_depth` parameters with parallel execution |
| **Multi-Arm Constraints** | Limit #pieces without bottom support to model 1-arm / 2-arm robots |
| **Assembly-by-Disassembly Mode** | Automatically searches from goal ‚Üí start, then reverses plan |
| **Headless or GUI Simulation** | Off-screen rendering for fast evaluation, optional OpenGL viewer |
| **CSV / GIF Logging** | Saves per-step states, tracks move cost, and generates animated assembly sequence |
